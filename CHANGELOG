- 0.5.3 - 06-07-2025

- Fix: Build failures with C23 (#100)

- 0.5.2 - 05-13-2025

- Specify void* argument in rbtrace_gc_mark()'s signature, as expected by rb_data_type_t.
  This was a warning before C23 but it's now an error, and GCC 15 defaults to C23.

- 0.5.1 - 19-12-2023

- Fix: RbTrace was used incorrectly instead of RBTrace, which lead to a broken build

- 0.5.0 - 02-12-2023

- Improved --backtraces implementation
- Added --shapedump which is useful for lighter weight object shape dumps on Ruby 3.2 and up
- Move heap dumping to a fork for better performance
- Use TypedData API which has been supported for a very long time
- Update CI and fix some small errors
